4Nlinux sounds like "Fall in linux", just like some one says "I fall in love with someone.".  
Yes! I fall in love with Linux, even through need more time to learn it.  
And, four 'N' have other meanings:  
- Never hold back!
- Do Not be so stingy!
- Do Not push for quick profits!
- Do Not lost your focus!

I want to do my best help those want to know more about linux, and make my own distribution, named 4Nlinux.
